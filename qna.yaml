    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What does valuing power and influence suggest about the types of roles you might seek in your career?

You are motivated by the opportunity to shape outcomes and are willing to embrace additional responsibility to expand your influence. Even when decisions may be unpopular, your comfort with making tough choices indicates a natural fit for leadership or strategic decision-making positions.

      ## COGNITIVE crafting
      
      involves how you see your work and connects with your core values; why your work, or the way you do your work, feels important to you. You might consider how you make a difference to colleagues, your organisation and to your family and friends. This helps to bring meaning to your work.

      ## RELATIONAL crafting
      relationships are often a big part of what drives our career motivations and help us effect change in positive ways. There may be ways you can strengthen your relationships to achieve greater work satisfaction, to gain new insights or receive feedback to help you develop.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What is cognitive crafting, and how does it influence how someone views their work?
        answer: Cognitive crafting involves how an individual perceives their work and how it connects with their core values. It focuses on why the work, or the way the work is performed, feels meaningful. Through cognitive crafting, a person might reflect on the difference they make to colleagues, their organisation, and even to their family and friends. This perspective helps to bring a deeper sense of purpose and personal significance to their daily activities.
      - question: How can strengthening relationships through relational crafting improve work satisfaction?
        answer: Strengthening relationships through relational crafting can significantly enhance work satisfaction by deepening the sense of connection, trust, and collaboration with others. Building stronger relationships can lead to gaining new insights, receiving valuable feedback for development, and creating a more supportive and positive work environment. Because relationships often drive career motivation and enable positive change, focusing on relational crafting allows individuals to feel more engaged and fulfilled in their roles.
      - question: Why might cognitive and relational crafting both be important for someone seeking greater alignment in their career?
        answer: Cognitive and relational crafting are both important because they address different but complementary aspects of career satisfaction. Cognitive crafting helps individuals find personal meaning in their work by aligning tasks with their core values, while relational crafting strengthens the social connections that often drive motivation and development. Together, these forms of crafting allow someone to experience both a sense of purpose and strong interpersonal support, leading to greater overall alignment, engagement, and fulfillment in their career.
