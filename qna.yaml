      Hopefully this tool has provided you with some fresh perspectives on how you can achieve greater career satisfaction in your current role whilst also helping you discover the motivators that are important for your career choices in the future.  Taking this a stage further might involve seeking conversations with others, especially your manager if you want to change or influence aspects of your current role. Tips for career crafting conversations include:

      - · Before the meeting, identify specific changes rather than general points, and how these align with your career motivators
      - · Consider the impact of changes on others, potential benefits and how any challenges could be mitigated
      - · Help the decision-maker understand how career crafting would make a positive difference to you by sharing your career motivators and stories from your own experience
      - · Openness to alternative propositions for role-redesign may help you to reach a win:win outcome
      - · If changes to your role are not immediately possible, think about other ways to satisfy your career motivators that could include non-work projects and opportunities
